# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard 📊☕

## 📖 Project Overview

This Excel dashboard project was part of my early journey into data analysis.  
I worked with a dataset of **1,50,000+ records across 14 fields**, covering transactional sales from a coffee shop chain.

The objective: Transform raw sales data into a **decision-support tool** using only Excel.

## 💼 Business Problem

The coffee shop team wanted insights into:
- 🔍 Sales trends by hour and weekday
- ☕ Best-performing products
- 📍 Location-wise sales performance
- 👥 Employee contribution to total sales
- 📈 In-store vs takeaway trends

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel  
- Pivot Tables and Slicers  
- KPI calculation and trend analysis  
- Dynamic charts and formatting  
- Dashboard design with a business-first layout

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Fridays and weekends** had the highest footfall and revenue  
- **Morning (8–10 AM)** and **evening (4–6 PM)** were peak times  
- **Espresso and Cappuccino** were top sellers  
- Some employees outperformed significantly — great for recognition  
- **Takeaway orders** showed consistent growth

✅ Strategic Recommendations:
- 📅 Increase staffing during peak hours (8–10 AM, 4–6 PM) and high-sales days (Fridays, weekends).
- 🌟 Reward high-performing employees; assign them key shifts or leadership roles.
- ☕ Promote top-selling items (Espresso, Cappuccino) with bundles, loyalty programs, or seasonal deals.
- 🚀 Improve takeaway experience with better packaging, faster service, and digital order incentives.
- 📍 Customize promotions and inventory based on location-wise sales performance.


## 🎯 Outcome

- Built a fully interactive Excel dashboard  
- Enabled quick decision-making for staffing, inventory, and product promotions  
- Learned how to turn large volumes of data into a **clear business narrative**

📌 This project laid the groundwork for my journey into tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python.
